# Sol_Contract_3
This contract enables the payer to vote for the address where is/her money will be going.
In here, we try to create a request structure for the contract where the contract manager can request all other members to provide their money to a certain vendor.
If they are interested, they can vote yes else no.
If the yes votes percentage is in majority, vendor will get the money.
